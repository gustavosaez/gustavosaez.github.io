Hi, here's your quick guide to _Ephe_.

Give me just one quiet minute.


Every morning, my head feels noisy.  
Ideas, todos, worries—all tangled.  
So I built Ephe to help organize my mind.

Just one page.  
A calm space.  
I write what matters today.

A task I want to focus on.  
A thought I didn’t know I had.  
A plan that formed as I typed.

I write, and my mind feels lighter.  
That’s how I start my day.


How to use Ephe?

It stays out of your way, but helps where it counts:

- `-[ ` or `- [ ` → auto-completes to `- [ ]` for tasks  
- <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> → formats your Markdown  
- <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> → takes a snapshot  
- You can see snapshots and task history recorded  
- <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> → opens the quick command menu  
- Customize appearance (Dark mode, Paper style, Width) from the bottom-left settings
- Task Flush (If set to instant, closing a task (`- [ ]`) deletes the line immediately)


I hope this one page helps you start your day with focus.
