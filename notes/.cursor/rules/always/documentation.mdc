# Documentation & Comments

## Code Comments
- Comments should only be used for complex logic
- Write comments in English
- Focus on explaining "why", not "what" or "how"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Function Documentation
- Document complex functions with a brief description
- Include parameter descriptions for non-obvious inputs
- Document return values and side effects
- Use JSDoc format for TypeScript functions, but don't need type params

## Example
```typescript
/**
 * Processes markdown content and extracts headings
 */
export const extractHeadings = (content: string): Heading[] => {
  // Implementation
}
```
