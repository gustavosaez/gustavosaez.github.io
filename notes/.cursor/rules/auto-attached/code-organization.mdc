# Code Organization

## Feature Structure
- Features should be organized into their own directories
- Each feature should export a clear public API
- Internal implementation details should be hidden

## Component Structure
- Components should follow a functional design pattern
- Use composition over inheritance
- Break down complex components into smaller, reusable parts
- Co-locate related files (component, hooks, tests, types)

## Best Practices
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use named exports for most modules
- Use default exports only for CSR components
