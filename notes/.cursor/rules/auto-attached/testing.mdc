# Testing Guidelines

## Testing Framework

- Use `vitest` for unit testing
- Use `playwirhgt` for e2e testing
 
## Unit Testing Best Practices

- Tests are colocated next to the tested file
  - e.g. `dir/index.ts` and `dir/index.test.ts`  
- Each test should be independent
- Use descriptive test names
- Use mocks only if external dependencies are needed

## E2E Testing Best Practices

- Reliable tests
