# State Management

## Overview
- This project uses [Jotai](mdc:https:/jotai.org) for state management
- Atoms are the primary unit of state

## Best Practices
- Keep atoms small and focused on a single responsibility
- Derived atoms should be used for computed state
- Atoms should be defined in the feature directories they relate to
- Use async atoms for side effects

## State Structure
- Editor state is managed by CodeMirror and Jotai
- System state includes app-wide settings and configurations
- History state tracks document changes
