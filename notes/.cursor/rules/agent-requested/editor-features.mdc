# Editor Features

## CodeMirror Integration
- The editor is built on [CodeMirror v6](mdc:https:/codemirror.net/6)
- Custom extensions are defined in [src/features/editor/codemirror/](mdc:src/features/editor/codemirror)
- Markdown parsing uses [@textlint/markdown-to-ast](mdc:https:/github.com/textlint/textlint/tree/master/packages/@textlint/markdown-to-ast)

## Key Editor Features
- Syntax highlighting for Markdown
- Table of Contents generation
- Command palette integration
- History and snapshots
- Tab detection and management

## Performance Considerations
- Editor operations should be optimized for performance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use memoization for expensive computations
- Debounce input events when appropriate
